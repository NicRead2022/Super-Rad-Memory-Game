<!-- I need a heading declaring the name of the game(h1)
I need a paragraph describing the objective of the game and how it is played(h2)
I need to determine the Harry Potter characters
  *Harry, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore
      *Assign them to a place on the grid
Code the grid
i need to make each "card" a box Button function?
  *
if/else loops to have the program check if the cards that were picked are a match and then to have them "voided out"
I need images for my cards. I think it will be easier to have an image appear rather then have the card flip over and then appear
When a card is turned over, when there is not a match, when there is a match -->
